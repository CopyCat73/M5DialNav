# M5DialNav
 Simple M5Dial navigation tool


A simple navigation tool I created for a boat using an M5Dial, M5Stack IMU Pro and M5Stack GPS unit. Initially I wanted to use the IMU as a magnetic compass but that is just too much hassle and the GPS makes it a lot easier. IMU is only used for temperature now.
